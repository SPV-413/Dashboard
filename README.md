# AutoViz Dashboard: Visualize Data Effortlessly 
AutoViz Dashboard is an interactive data visualization tool built with Streamlit and Plotly. It empowers users to easily upload their CSV, Excel, or JSON files and transform raw data into insightful, dynamic visualizations—all with minimal setup. Efficient caching ensures fast loading and processing every time you explore your data.

## Key Features
- Seamless File Upload & Caching: Quickly load CSV, Excel, or JSON files. Intelligent caching minimizes repeat data processing, accelerating data exploration.

- Robust Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Automates critical cleaning steps such as:

  - Dropping columns with excessive missing or constant values
  - Removing duplicate rows and fully null records
  - Filtering special characters and converting numeric-like strings
  - Filling missing values and removing outliers via the IQR method

- Comprehensive Dashboards: Generates dynamic dashboards featuring:

  - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displaying metrics like mean and standard deviation
  - Univariate Analysis: Customizable histograms, bar charts, pie charts, and more
  - Bivariate & Time Series Analysis: Interactive scatter plots, box plots, density maps, and line/area charts
  - Geospatial Mapping: Integrated maps including scatter, choropleth, or density views for location-based insights

## Workflow
- Upload Your Data: Use the uploader to load CSV, Excel, or JSON files into the dashboard.

- Data Preview & Cleaning: Preview your dataset and choose to remove unwanted features. The app then cleans your data by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers—all while logging the changes for transparency.

- Configure & Filter: Dynamically filter your data using interactive sidebars to narrow down on specific categorical or numeric features.

- Visualize & Explore: Instantly generate a host of charts:

- Univariate Visuals to understand distributions

- Bivariate & Correlation Analyses for relationships

- Time Series & Geospatial Visualizations for trend spotting and location data insights

## Business Use Cases
- **Data Exploration & Reporting**: Quickly convert raw data into visual stories to share with stakeholders, making complex analyses accessible to non-technical teams.

- **Market & Location Analysis**: Leverage geospatial features to analyze regional trends, customer distribution, or operational footprints.

- **Pre-Modeling Preparation**: Clean and preprocess datasets to serve as precise inputs for further advanced analytics or machine learning workflows.

## Who Can Use This App
- **Data Analysts & Scientists**: For rapid, exploratory data analysis without complex coding.

- **Business Professionals**: To generate dashboards and reports that drive strategic decisions.

- **Researchers**: Who need to visualize trends and patterns effectively in their datasets.

- **Decision Makers**: Seeking easy-to-understand visuals to support evidence-based strategies.
